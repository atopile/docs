atopile brings the power of software development workflows to hardware design.
By describing electronics with code, you can leverage, modularity version control, and deep validation.

Capture design intelligence and constraints directly in your code, enabling auto-selection of
components, embedded calculations checked on every build, and reliable, configurable modules.

This allows for rapid iteration, easier collaboration, and robust designs validated through
continuous integration.
