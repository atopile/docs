<Update label="v0.4" description="Packages ðŸ“¦">
atopile's package management system has had a huge upgrade!

To find packages, check out the entirely overhauled [package index](https://packages.atopile.io).

The new commands to packages are clearer and help keep the packages all in sync. See the updated [package guide](/atopile/essentials/4-packages).

If you're looking to publish your own packages, [check out the guide](/atopile/guides/publish).

## Upgrading

- The `ato-version` field in your `ato.yaml` is now called `requires-atopile`. It remains a version spec, and we recommend that you set it to `^0.4.0`.
- The structure of dependencies have changed! It's best to remap them to the new registry, using the `ato add` command. **Note:** that many of the package names have also changed.
- The `import` identifiers have also changed - to match the new project identifiers. Update these to `from "{package-identifier}/file.ato" import MyThing`.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.3" description="A big release with a lot of new infrastructure">

Firstly, thanks for using atopile! It's been a ride, and we're glad you're here. ðŸ™Œ

### Changed Commands

Add `--help` after any command to see new options in the CLI. This is always the most accurate source of information.

| Old                    | New                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `ato install --jlcpcb` | `ato create component` |


### I'm seeing a bunch of `DeprecationWarning`

There will be a LOT of new deprecation warnings you'll see.

For the most part, it's safe to ignore them for the minute, and we plan to make the breaking changes in 0.4.0

Upgrading will give you more access to features as they're added, but there's no need to rush if you're content.

### PCBs are now directly modified

This means no more need to open the PCB file, import the netlist and cycle.

`ato build` now directly modifies the PCB file as required on each build.


### Standard Library (previously `generics`) is now shipped built-in!

This vastly improves our ability to version and iterate on the standard library, use the best practices and latest features.

See [`library`](https://github.com/atopile/atopile/tree/main/src/faebryk/library) for the latest and greatest.

It should be better documented. If this is important for you, please vote on the [issue](https://github.com/atopile/atopile/issues/936).
