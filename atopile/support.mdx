## Immediate Support

The "help" channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/JY62WubxsP) is the best way to get an immediate hand with anything the docs don't cover.

## Commercial Support

For support of commercial projects using atopile, Discord remains a great resource, however please contact us at [hi@atopile.io](mailto:hi@atopile.io) for specific projects.
