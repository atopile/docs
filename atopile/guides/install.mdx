Ultimately, `atopile` is a Python package, so you can install it wherever and however you wantâ€”but some Python package managers are better than others. Here's the recommended method to install atopile.


## Homebrew `brew` <small>(recommended for macOS)</small>

``` sh
brew install atopile/tap/atopile
```


## `uv` <small>(recommended for other platforms)</small>

1. Install `uv`. See: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

2. Install atopile with `uv`

    ``` sh
    uv tool install atopile
    ```

    <Warning>
        If this is the first time you've used `uv` for a tool install, it might give you another command to run to finish setup.

        Do it.
    </Warning>

3. Check `ato` installed

    ``` sh
    ato --version
    ```
