# Disambiguation: `faebryk` vs `fabll` üêç

`faebryk` is atopile's core. It's the way the world is modeled.

`faebryk` is a Python module that uses a powerful and efficient core graph (nodes + edges) to represent every relationship in your design or circuit.

`fabll` is a Python framework to model circuits in, much like `ato` it acts as a language in the atopile ecosystem. It unlocks the whole power and ecosystem of Python to do design in.
