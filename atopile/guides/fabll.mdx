`fabll` is a Python framework to model circuits, much like `ato`. It unlocks the whole Turing-complete power of Python to do design in, plus low-level procedural code and logic. Think of it like writing C for a Python module. Its focus is power—not ease of use like `ato`—so it's not recommended for most designs to start with.

<Warning>
    `fabll` is currently in a very early stage of development. It's not publicly supported yet.

## Disambiguation: `fabll` vs `ato`
Think of it like the difference between C (fabll) and JavaScript (ato).
fabll is for really complicated modular building block modules, while ato is better for most of the composition and simple modules.

## Building `fabll` code

To build a `fabll` module with atopile, you just need to point to the module within your `ato.yaml` configuration file.

When you run `ato build`, atopile automatically builds the `fabll` module and links it to your project.

## Importing `fabll` code

You can just import `fabll` modules in `ato` like any other import:

```python
from "path/to/some/fabll.py" import SomeModule
```
