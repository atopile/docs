You've made something great and you want to share it. Awesome! ðŸ¥³ ðŸ™Œ

The best way to do this is to publish it to the [public atopile registry](https://packages.atopile.io), where it becomes available to everyone to embed in their projects.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Add package metadata">
        Packages need some additional metadata in their `ato.yaml` config to explain what they are, their version and to give you credit.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup GitHub Action">
        Install and configure our `atopile/publish-package` action.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Publish">
        The action will automatically package and publish your project whenever you're ready!
    </Step>
</Steps>


You can structure your project in two common ways. Keep an eye out for the notes on each, as they'll affect your workflow slightly
1. A **single package** in the repo, like [HiL](https://github.com/atopile/hil).
2. A **monorepo** with multiple separate packages, like [packages](https://github.com/atopile/packages). This is common when you're a larger org, and have a lot to share.
{/* 3. A project with multiple **sub-packages**, like [HiL](https://github.com/atopile/hil). This is common when you design something, and then later realise some part of it is useful on its own. */}


### Package Metadata

Here's an example of some package metadata. Copying this, and updating it with your own information is a good place to start.

**The first section of the identifier must be your GitHub username or organization name.** This is enforced on upload.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Single Package">
        Recommendations:
        - Name the repo the same as the package.
        - Version the package with releases, and use the tag as the version.

        ```yaml ato.yaml
        package:
            identifier: atopile/some-package
            repository: https://github.com/atopile/some-package
            authors:
                - name: Pepper
                  email: pepper@atopile.io
                - name: Narayan
                  email: naraya@atopile.io
            summary: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
            license: MIT
            homepage: https://github.com/atopile/some-package
        ```
    </Tab>
    {/* <Tab title="Sub-Packages">
        Recommendations:
        - Name the package the same as the repo
        - Version the package with releases, and use the tag as the version.

        ```yaml
        package:
            identifier: atopile/some-project
            repository: https://github.com/atopile/some-project
            authors:
                - name: Pepper
                email: pepper@atopile.io
                - name: Narayan
                email: naraya@atopile.io
            summary: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
            license: MIT
            homepage: https://github.com/atopile/some-project

        ```
    </Tab> */}
    <Tab title="Monorepo">
        Recommendations:
        - Create a separate atopile project for each package
        - Version the packages with a version in their own `ato.yaml` config

        ```yaml packages/some-package/ato.yaml
        package:
            identifier: atopile/some-package
            repository: https://github.com/atopile/packages
            version: "0.1.0"
            authors:
                - name: Pepper
                  email: pepper@atopile.io
                - name: Narayan
                  email: naraya@atopile.io
            summary: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
            license: MIT

        ```

### Configuring your publish workflow

Publishing is currently supported exclusively through the [atopile/publish-package](https://github.com/atopile/publish-package) action.

<Info>
    The reason only GitHub is supported at the moment is because we only currently support [GitHub OIDC tokens](https://github.com/atopile/fastapi-github-oidc) for authorization.
</Info>


<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Single Package">
        Recommendations:
        - Name the repo the same as the package.
        - Version the package with releases, and use the tag as the version.

        ```yaml
        on:
          release:
            types: [created]

          jobs:
            release:
              if: github.event.release.draft != true && github.event.release.prerelease != true
              runs-on: ubuntu-latest
              steps:
                - uses: actions/checkout@v4
                - uses: atopile/publish-package@main
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Monorepo">
        Recommendations:
        - Create a separate atopile project for each package
        - Version the packages with a version in their own `ato.yaml` config
        - Use the `package-entrypoint` input to specify the package to publish

        There are a bunch of ways to configure the workflow, but here's an example from our own [packages](https://github.com/atopile/packages/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) repo.
    </Tab>
    {/* Add a sub-package example here */}
</Tabs>


### Hitting "publish"!

This must be a valid [semver](https://semver.org/) string, with the following additional restrictions:
- No leading `v` character
- No pre-release or dev tags
- No build metadata

For example: `1.2.3`

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Single Package">
        Create a [release on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository), tagged as the version you want to publish.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Monorepo">
        Update the version in the `ato.yaml` config for the package you want to publish, and merge to main.
        ```yaml packages/some-package/ato.yaml {2}
        package:
            version: "0.1.0"  # <- Update this
        ```
    </Tab>
    {/* Add a sub-package example here */}
</Tabs>

## Reference

Nitty gritty details for advanced configuration.

### Package Metadata

#### `package.identifier`

The identifier is a unique identifier for the package. It must be in the form `{owner}/{name}`
, where `owner` is your GitHub username or organization name.

If the URL to your repository is `https://github.com/atopile/packages`, then your "owner" is `atopile`.
You can name your package whatever you want, but it must be unique within the owner.

#### `package.repository`

The repository is the URL to the repository containing the package source code. This should be a link to the repository on GitHub.

#### `package.version` [optional]

The version is the version of the package.

This must be a valid [semver](https://semver.org/) string, with the following additional restrictions:
- No leading `v` character
- No pre-release or dev tags
- No build metadata

If you want to dynamically generate the version leave this blank, and use the `package-version` action input instead.

#### `package.authors`

The authors are the people who should be credited for the package.
This is a list of, each with a `name` and `email`.

#### `package.summary`

The summary is a short description of the package.

#### `package.license`

The license describing the terms under which the package is released.

#### `package.homepage`

The homepage is the URL to the website where the package is documented or sold.
This can be a link to your GitHub repository, or perhaps your website where you sell or document it.
