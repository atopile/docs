title: "PowerSwitch"
icon: microchip
description: "
A generic module that switches power based on a logic signal, needs specialization

The logic signal is active high. When left floating, the state is determined by the
normally_closed parameter.

## Init Args

<ParamField path='normally_closed' type='bool'>

</ParamField>


## Interfaces

<ParamField path='logic_in' type='ElectricLogic'>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='power_in' type='ElectricPower'>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='switched_power_out' type='ElectricPower'>
</ParamField>


## Global Attributes


These attributes are available to all modules and interfaces in a design.
<ParamField path='lcsc_id' type='str'>

Assign the LCSC ID of the module.

If set, this will tell the picker to select that part from LCSC for this block.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='manufacturer' type='str'>

This module's manufacturer name, as a string.

Only exact matches on the manufacturer's name will be found by the picker.
It's recommended to fill this information based on what `ato create component`
provides.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='mpn' type='str'>

This module's manufacturer part number, as a string.

For the picker to select the correct part from the manufacturer,
this must be set.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='package' type='str'>

The package of the module.

This drives which components can be selected, and what footprint is used.

Must exactly match a known package name.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='exclude_from_bom' type='bool'>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='override_net_name' type='str'>

When set on an interface, this will override the net name of the interface.

This is useful for renaming nets which are automatically generated.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='required' type='bool'>

Only for ModuleInterfaces.
If set to `True`, require that interface is connected to something outside
of the module it's defined in.
</ParamField>

```ato Basic Usage
import PowerSwitch, ElectricPower, ElectricLogic

# Create normally-open power switch
power_switch = new PowerSwitch(normally_closed=False)

# Connect input power
input_power = new ElectricPower
assert input_power.voltage within 5V +/- 5%
power_switch.power_in ~ input_power

# Connect control signal
enable_signal = new ElectricLogic
enable_signal.reference ~ input_power
power_switch.logic_in ~ enable_signal

# Connect switched output to load
switched_output = new ElectricPower
power_switch.switched_power_out ~ switched_output
load_circuit ~ switched_output

# When enable_signal is HIGH, power flows to load
# When enable_signal is LOW (or floating), power is disconnected

# For normally-closed switch (fails safe)
fail_safe_switch = new PowerSwitch(normally_closed=True)
# This switch passes power when control is LOW or floating
