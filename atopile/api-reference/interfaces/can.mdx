## Parameters

<ParamField path='speed' type='baud'>
</ParamField>


## Interfaces

<ParamField path='diff_pair' type='DifferentialPair'>
</ParamField>


## Global Attributes


These attributes are available to all modules and interfaces in a design.
<ParamField path='lcsc_id' type='str'>

Assign the LCSC ID of the module.

If set, this will tell the picker to select that part from LCSC for this block.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='manufacturer' type='str'>

This module's manufacturer name, as a string.

Only exact matches on the manufacturer's name will be found by the picker.
It's recommended to fill this information based on what `ato create component`
provides.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='mpn' type='str'>

This module's manufacturer part number, as a string.

For the picker to select the correct part from the manufacturer,
this must be set.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='package' type='str'>

The package of the module.

This drives which components can be selected, and what footprint is used.

Must exactly match a known package name.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='exclude_from_bom' type='bool'>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='override_net_name' type='str'>

When set on an interface, this will override the net name of the interface.

This is useful for renaming nets which are automatically generated.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='required' type='bool'>

Only for ModuleInterfaces.
If set to `True`, require that interface is connected to something outside
of the module it's defined in.
</ParamField>

```ato Basic Usage
import CAN, ElectricPower, Resistor

can_bus = new CAN
can_bus.speed = 250kbps  # Common CAN speeds: 125k, 250k, 500k, 1Mbps
can_bus.diff_pair.impedance = 120ohm +/- 5%

# Connect power reference for logic levels
power_5v = new ElectricPower
assert power_5v.voltage within 5V +/- 5%
can_bus.diff_pair.p.reference ~ power_5v
can_bus.diff_pair.n.reference ~ power_5v

# Connect to CAN transceiver
can_transceiver.can_bus ~ can_bus

# Connect to microcontroller CAN peripheral
microcontroller.can ~ can_transceiver.mcu_interface

# CAN termination resistors (120 ohm at each end of bus)
termination_resistor = new Resistor
termination_resistor.resistance = 120ohm +/- 1%
can_bus.diff_pair.p.line ~> termination_resistor ~> can_bus.diff_pair.n.line

# Common applications: automotive, industrial automation, IoT
