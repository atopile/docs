## Parameters

<ParamField path='bus_max_current_consumption_sum' type='ampere'>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='max_current' type='ampere'>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='voltage' type='volt'>
</ParamField>


## Interfaces

<ParamField path='hv' type='Electrical'>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='lv' type='Electrical'>
</ParamField>


## Global Attributes


These attributes are available to all modules and interfaces in a design.
<ParamField path='lcsc_id' type='str'>

Assign the LCSC ID of the module.

If set, this will tell the picker to select that part from LCSC for this block.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='manufacturer' type='str'>

This module's manufacturer name, as a string.

Only exact matches on the manufacturer's name will be found by the picker.
It's recommended to fill this information based on what `ato create component`
provides.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='mpn' type='str'>

This module's manufacturer part number, as a string.

For the picker to select the correct part from the manufacturer,
this must be set.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='package' type='str'>

The package of the module.

This drives which components can be selected, and what footprint is used.

Must exactly match a known package name.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='exclude_from_bom' type='bool'>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='override_net_name' type='str'>

When set on an interface, this will override the net name of the interface.

This is useful for renaming nets which are automatically generated.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='required' type='bool'>

Only for ModuleInterfaces.
If set to `True`, require that interface is connected to something outside
of the module it's defined in.
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>
```ato Basic Usage
import ElectricPower

power_5v = new ElectricPower
assert power_5v.voltage within 5V +/- 5%
assert power_5v.max_current <= 1A

# Connect 2 ElectricPowers together
power_5v ~ ic.power_input

# Connect an example bypass capacitor
power_5v.hv ~> example_capacitor ~> power_5v.lv
```
