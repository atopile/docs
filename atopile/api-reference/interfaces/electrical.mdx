## Global Attributes


These attributes are available to all modules and interfaces in a design.
<ParamField path='lcsc_id' type='str'>

Assign the LCSC ID of the module.

If set, this will tell the picker to select that part from LCSC for this block.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='manufacturer' type='str'>

This module's manufacturer name, as a string.

Only exact matches on the manufacturer's name will be found by the picker.
It's recommended to fill this information based on what `ato create component`
provides.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='mpn' type='str'>

This module's manufacturer part number, as a string.

For the picker to select the correct part from the manufacturer,
this must be set.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='package' type='str'>

The package of the module.

This drives which components can be selected, and what footprint is used.

Must exactly match a known package name.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='exclude_from_bom' type='bool'>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='override_net_name' type='str'>

When set on an interface, this will override the net name of the interface.

This is useful for renaming nets which are automatically generated.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='required' type='bool'>

Only for ModuleInterfaces.
If set to `True`, require that interface is connected to something outside
of the module it's defined in.
</ParamField>

```ato Basic Usage
import Electrical, Resistor, Capacitor

# Basic electrical connection point
electrical1 = new Electrical
electrical2 = new Electrical

# Connect two electrical interfaces directly
electrical1 ~ electrical2

# Connect through components
resistor = new Resistor
resistor.resistance = 1kohm +/- 5%
electrical1 ~ resistor.unnamed[0]
resistor.unnamed[1] ~ electrical2

# Or using bridge syntax
electrical1 ~> resistor ~> electrical2

# Multiple connections to same net
capacitor = new Capacitor
electrical1 ~ capacitor.unnamed[0]
capacitor.unnamed[1] ~ electrical2
```
