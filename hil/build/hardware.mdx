Custom test equipment is a strategic investment that pays dividends throughout your product's lifecycle. While general-purpose tools have their place, purpose-built test hardware delivers compelling advantages:

- **Lower total cost** - Dedicated hardware optimized for your specific tests is often more cost-effective than general-purpose equipment, especially at scale
- **Tighter integration** - Purpose-built interfaces mean seamless communication with your test framework, enabling true automation
- **Higher reliability** - Hardware designed for a specific test case can be made more robust and reliable than adapting general-purpose equipment

We've developed a range of modular test hardware blocks that deliver these benefits while remaining flexible enough to adapt to your needs. Some of our most popular modules include:

- **Battery Cell Simulator (8-channel):** Simulates 8 individual battery cells, often used for testing Battery Management Systems (BMS). Typically features voltage and current control per channel, isolation, and stackability.
- **Thermistor Reader (8-channel):** Measures temperature from up to 8 thermistors simultaneously.
- **Heater Controller:** Controls a heating element, useful for thermal testing or environment simulation.
- **Analog Input (4-channel):** Reads up to 4 analog voltage signals.
- **Analog Output (4-channel):** Generates up to 4 analog voltage signals.
- **Relay Module:** Switches higher power or isolated circuits using electromechanical relays.
- **CAN Interface:** Enables communication with devices on a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus.
- **Black Magic Debugger Interface:** Standard JTAG/SWD connector compatible with Black Magic Probe debuggers.
- **Digital Variable Resistor:** Software-controlled resistance, useful for simulating sensors or tuning analog circuits.
